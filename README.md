# weather-Data-prediction
A Python project to visualize weather data using OOP and graphs and train model for rain prediction

## 📁 Project Structure

---project/
│
├── project1.ipynb # Main Jupyter notebook
├── update.ipynb # Updated version of notebook
├── weather.csv # (Your CSV file for weather data)
└── README.md # Project documentation

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and analyze weather data from a CSV file.
- Use OOP to organize different types of plots.
- Visualize weather patterns using various chart types:
  - Bar Plot
  - Histogram
  - Scatter Plot
  - Pie Chart
  - Line Chart
  - Heatmap
  - Area Chart

---

## 📊 Visualizations

Each method in the `Graphs` class generates a different plot:

- `barplot()` – Rain count visualization
- `histogram()` – Distribution of temperature
- `scatterplot()` – Relationship between temperature and humidity
- `piechart()` – Proportion of rainy vs non-rainy days
- `line_chart()` – Trend of temperature over index
- `heatmap()` – Correlation between numerical features
- `area_chart()` – Combined area view of temperature and humidity

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed with the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   Open update.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or any IDE like VS Code.

Run the cells to:

Load data

Initialize the Graphs class

Call each plot method one by one to view graphs
🧠 Learning Outcomes
Improved understanding of object-oriented programming in Python.

Learned how to use data visualization libraries effectively.

Developed a clean, modular, and reusable code structure for visual analysis.
